# LED Controller

Single button LED controller to replace a defective standard controller for non-addressable LEDs. Adjusting colors works as follows:

- **Long press** (>1s): Sweep selected parameter through HSV color space
- **Short press** (<250ms) Switch HSV parameter index which is edited by long press
- **Inbetween press**: Switch between chosen and initially defined color
